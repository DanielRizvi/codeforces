# codeforces

This repository is a personal archive of my solutions to problems on Codeforces — one of the most dynamic platforms for competitive programming. It documents my growth, learning process, and love for problem-solving in the form of clean, structured, and commented code.

Each commit is not just a solution — it's a step forward in mastering algorithmic thinking.
